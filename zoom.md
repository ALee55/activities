Some reminders for using Zoom ...

1. Install Zoom here: https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/sections/200704559-Installation
2. Please test your webcam and microphone before our first class meeting.
3. Have headphones nearby in case your microphone is sensitive enough to pick up sound from your speakers. This will create an echo effect or cause a feedback loop with a terrible screeching sound.
4. In zoom, you can use the chat area to share links, ask questions without interrupting, etc.
