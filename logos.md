# Logo and Branding

According to almost any business resources, branding is "The process involved in creating a unique name and image for a product in the consumers' mind, mainly through advertising campaigns with a consistent theme. Branding aims to establish a significant and differentiated presence in the market that attracts and retains loyal customers." [source](http://www.businessdictionary.com/definition/branding.html) Logo design is just one aspect of how branding principles are applied in and outside of business. A logo is a graphic mark, emblem, or symbol used to aid and promote public recognition. This I'm sure you know, as you have probably encountered countless logos. Logos are generally divided into three categories: standalone symbol, logotype/wordmark, and combination marks. Most branding concepts include all three. 

Using Microsoft Word, write a brief description for an imagined company. What is your dream company? What does it do, sell, or make? Who is the target audience/customer? 

Next, using Photoshop, try making a combination mark logo for this imagined company. What aspects of the company would this logo need to communicate? Think about representation, association, size, color, typeface, alignment, and how the logo might be used with a new company slogan or other advertising elements. Upload your description and logo to Box when finished.
