# Embedded Writing Activity 

For class today we read an example of embedded fiction; that is, a work of fiction embedded in an existing online platform. Writers have toyed with fiction in a variety of online platforms such as Youtube, Amazon product reviews, Tweets, and even Craigslist content. In class today, I want you to choose an online text genre such as the examples above and write a satirical or parodic version of that form. Write your content in Microsoft Word or an equivalent program and upload it to your Box folder for this class when you are finished. We will work on this assignment for about 15 minutes.
