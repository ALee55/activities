# Using Adobe Photoshop to Emphasize

We have talked about numerous design elements that indicate points of emphasis. Spatial patterns like the Gutenberg Diagram and the golden grid tell where someone's eye is most likely to be drawn. Cognitive techniques like framing and priming take advantage of the mind works to emphasize some aspect of how an idea or call to action will be interpreted. Highlighting techniques (boldness, typeface, color, and inversion) can also be used to emphasize specific page elements. Icons make certain ideas or piece of information easier to process and more memorable.

Rhetoric and narrative theory have similar ways of thinking about emphasis. Fiction employs a range of strategies to create a feeling of access to a narrative's storyworld, as well as various characters' inner consciousness or mental state. Methods like word choice, repetition, and playing on the "sound  properties" of spoken language are just some of the tools in a writer's toolbox to create these effects.

In class today, we will experiment with emphasis by altering vintage advertisements. I've collected  a [Box.com folder of advertisements for you to download and use for this assignment](https://pitt.box.com/s/b2iat58koypf8rlwg42gh7cjq1eh0te9). Your goal is to play with the visual and rhetorical elements of an advertisement, using Adobe Photoshop, to transform the advertisement in a meaningful way. 

How should you change the advertisement? First, choose one the following modes:

1. Remix, which "appropriates and changes other materials to create something new." 

2. Parody, which imitates "with deliberate exaggeration for comic effect." 

3. Homage, which is a show of respect using allusion or imitation. 

Next, decide on a theme for your change. Depending on which mode you've chosen, you may be trying to integrate an allusion to something, playing up a humorous aspect of the product, or editing the advertisement to make it a tribute to something else. You should be able to edit the file using introductory techniques like cropping, adjusting the colors, layering, adding filters, resizing, and adding text to reshape the object. Upload your work to your Box.com folder for Composing Digital Media when you are finished.
