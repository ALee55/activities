# Flesh Out Your Github Pages Site

## Part 1: Read the Assignment Description for Work-in-Progress Submission 1

The assignment description at https://cdm-spring-2020.matthew-lavin.com/assignments/work-in-progress-1 contains details about the overall scope of your Github Pages site, as well as the content that you will includ ein your first work-in-progress submission. You should read this assignment before doing anything else, as it will help explain the next few steps.

## Part 2: Make landing pages and menus 

In this part of the assignment, you will make all html pages for future content, as well as your top level menu, and the Work-in-Progress submission sub-menu. The folder and pages you need to make are as follows:

/index.html

/portfolio/index.html 

/presentation/index.html 

/work-1/index.html 

/work-1/sample-1/index.html

/work-1/sample-2/index.html

/work-2/index.html 

/static/readme.md

The main menu will be placed on every page in the same place, but you will need to edit the link value for some of the href attributes. The top-level links are as follows:

- Home 

- Work-in-Progress 1

- Work-in-Progress 2

- Work-in-Progress Presentation

- Final Portfolio

Visit https://github.com/cdm-spring-2020/course-website-2020 for an online example of the page structure I am asking you to create.

The submenu only goes on the following pages:

- work-1/index.html 

- /work-1/sample-1/index.html

- /work-1/sample-2/index.html

This menu should include a link to each of these three pages. 

## Part 3: Start adding content 

1. If you haven't done so already, add your written biography to the index.html page at the top location. 

2. Add the first draft of your embedded fiction writing activity to the following location:

- /work-1/sample-1/index.html

3. Add the first draft of your design concept writing assignment to the following location:

- /work-1/sample-2/index.html

NOTE: You will need to convert your text from Word to html by adding html tags to the text.
