# Asynchronous activities

The general purpose of these instructions is to allow students to complete all remaining work for the semester on their own timetable. Items are listed in the recommended order, but how you go about completing each item is largely up to you. For your convenience, I have also included a suggested due date. It will be your responsibility, however, to complete work and keep your checklist up to date. 

1. Complete Work-in-Progress Submission 2

3. Complete Audacity tutorial 2: Mixing a Narration with Background Music (requires audacity) 
	https://manual.audacityteam.org/man/tutorial_mixing_a_narration_with_background_music.html

	Suggested due date: March 30

4. Complete Audacity tutorial 3: Vocal Removal and Isolation (requires audacity) 
	https://manual.audacityteam.org/man/tutorial_vocal_removal_and_isolation.html

	Suggested due date: April 1

5. Complete Audacity tutorial 4: Looping (requires audacity) 
	https://manual.audacityteam.org/man/tutorial_looping.html

	Suggested due date: April 1

6. Read Horton and Quesenbery, "A web for everyone" 
	https://pitt.box.com/s/uotccy5i75qngcqbzvu6lf24b1k91xao

	Suggested due date: April 6

7. Complete Quiz 5
	Sarah Horton and Whitney Quesenbery write about the importance of inclusive design, which includes the principles of designing for differences, having well defined goals, building to standards, easing interactions, creating helpful wayfinding that guides users, having clean presentation that supports meaning, using plain language, implementing media that supports all senses, and creating delight. Do an inventory of your Github pages site and write a 500-word response indicating all the ways you are following or not following these principles. In cases where you are falling short, provide details on how you might improve. Turn in your written response via your Box folder. 

	Suggested due date: April 6

8. If you haven't yet delivered your Pecha Kucha, ... If you have already delivered your Pecha Kucha, skip to item 2
	
	I am asking you to record delivering your Pecha Kucha and share a video via Box. You can do this by making a screencast recording, or by recording a timed narration. The screencast option is relatively simple and can be done with Zoom (see https://blog.smu.edu/itconnect/2017/08/23/using-zoom-create-quick-easy-screen-recordings-free/) In powerpoint, there is a menu item to "record slide show." (More details at https://support.office.com/en-us/article/record-a-slide-show-with-narration-and-slide-timings-0b9502c6-5f6c-40ae-b1e7-e47d8741161c) In Google Slides, you have to record your audio separately, so the screencast option is probably best. 

	Suggested due date: April 8

9. Put your Pecha Kucha slides on your Github pages website under the link for "Work-in-Progress Presentation." 
	Instructions for this action will vary based on the format of your presentation, but the slides should be embedded onto the page, not merely linked or downloadable. For Google slides, this means embedding an iframe. See https://help.edublogs.org/google-slides/ and https://datavizforall.org/iframe-github.html. For PowerPoint users, converting your document to slideshare may be the best strategy. Once you have uploaded your slideshow, you can get an iframe embed code (see https://www.slideshare.net/thinkoutsidetheslide/converting-your-written-content-to-a-slideshare-deck/50-Embed_using_the_iframe_codeUse).

	Suggested due date: April 13

10. Complete soundscape activity, parts 1 and 2 (requires audacity)

	Suggested due date: April 15

11. Complete peer review assignment

	For this assignment, I have assigned partners for all students. By the due date, you will visit your partner's Github Pages site (links are listed below) and provide the 200-250-word responses to the prompts below. Email your responses to your partner and CC me so I know you have completed the assignment. 

	__Prompts__:

	I. Are all the required components present, such as menus/links, submenus, written reflections, and media samples from classwork assignments? 

	II. Evaluate your partner's attention to detail in writing and code. This can include items such as grammar, punctuation, capitalization, spelling, and syntax, as well as careful attention to proofreading. 

	III. Are there any issues with page rendering, such as broken links, images that don't display, CSS not working, etc. 

	IV. Comment on your partner's design concept. Does there appear to be a clear intention of design behind the site? Does it work as a whole? IS there a synthesis of form and content?  

	V. Comment on the ease of use of your partner's site. Are there any issues of accessibility and/or usability that need to be addressed? 

	VI. What are the main differences between your Github pages site your partnerâ€™s? What are the strengths and weaknesses of each?
