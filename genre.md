# Genre Association and Representation

Last week, we began to use photoshop to engage with concepts that help makers emphasize certain aspects of their work. This week, our theme is expectations. Some of the principles of design we've already discussed relate to expectations: things like the golden grid and the Gutenberg diagram are reinforced by the structures users expect to see. Similarly, since various media afford different modes of expression, medium also generates expectations. Lastly, we need to recognize genre as one of the most imnportant expectation-setters. 

Expectatations can be met or played with but, as the Arola et. al. tell us (by example) that there are two important questions we might want to ask ourselves as we play with genre: 

1. Do you need to follow a genre convention for some reason related to audience comprehension or approval? 

2. Are there good reasons to break with this genre convention?

In class, we will break into teams of 3-4 students and continue our experiments with Photoshop. We'll play with genre by association and representation. 

- First, your team will receive a piece of paper with a genre on it. 

- Second, you will choose a movie in that genre and locate high resolution image of a movie poster for that movie.

- Lastly, you will receive a secon piece of paper with a second genre on it. 

Members of each team will work together to edit the poster or recreate it, so that it appears to belong to the second genre you've been assigned. Use tonal elemnts like color, shadow, font, aignment, etc. to convey the new genre. 

Divide up the work however you choose, but make sure everyone has a role. Upload your work to your Box.com folder when you are finished (one upload per team is fine, but name the file so that everyone's last name is included).
